###Description

Yii extension to support the [Galleria](http://galleria.aino.se/) Javascript image gallery.
The galleria files that are included are from commit: 373a3a77e83eef919046.

###Install

Extract the zip file under the extension folder and should look like.
~~~
    ./webapp/protected/extension/EGalleria
~~~

or use the github.com and clone the repository under the extension folder.
~~~
    git clone https://github.com/dmtra/EGalleria
~~~

###Configuration

Add import of EGalleria extension in your config/main.php file:

~~~
[php]
    'imports'=>array(
        ...
        'application.extensions.EGalleria'
        ...
    ),
~~~    

###Use

You can use the widget in 2 diff ways. You can attach a dataProvider and the images will 
be rendered from that provider or you can create the dom structure need for the galleria 
plugin your own.

####With Dataprovider

To bind a dataprovider with the widget you need to specify which of the model attributes 
is the url for the image.

This can be achieved in 2 ways:
- By pasing "binding" attribute at the initialization of widget.
- DefineEGalleriaBehavior in your model behaviors() function.

"Behavior" feature is usefull when you want to use same model for more than 1 EGalleria widget
so you don't have to define binding again and again.

####Behavior definition

In your model behaviors() function add:

~~~
[php]
    public function behaviors()
    {
        ...
        'egalleria'=>array(
            'class'=>'application.extensions.EGalleria.EGalleriaBehavior',
            'image'=>'image_field_name', //This is a required binding and will be the src of image element
            'description'=>'image_description', //Optional
            'title'=>'image_title', //Optional
            'link'=>'image_link', //NOT SUPPORTED IN CURRENT VERSION
            'author'=>'image's_author' //NOT SUPPORTED IN CURRENT VERSION
        ),
        ...
    }
~~~

####Binding in initialization of widget

Check later in example.

###Examples

In your view file add.

1. Use of dataprovider with behavior defined in model.

~~~
[php]
$data = new CActiveDataProvider();
$this->widget('EGalleria', array(
    'dataProvider'=>$data,    
));
~~~

2. Define binding in init with no model behavior

~~~
[php]
$data = new CActiveDataProvider();
$this->widget('EGalleria', array(
    'dataProvider'=>$data,
    'binding'=>array(
        'image'=>'model_image_src_field',
    ),
));
~~~
